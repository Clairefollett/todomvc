#Learn Flux
This is my experimental repo for learning [flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/).

It's a simple TODO list made using flux architecure, ES6 and ReactJS. [Live Demo](vkbansal.github.io/learn-flux/).

## Tools used
- [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react) - Awesome library for making ui components
- [Alt](https://github.com/goatslacker/alt) - Flux implementation
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - ES6 to ES5 transpiler
- [React-DnD](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd) - Drag and drop for React with full DOM control
- [ImmutableJS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) - Immutable persistent data collections for Javascript which increase efficiency and simplicity.

## Usage
- Clone the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `gulp` for automatic build, watch and livereload.
- A server will also be started @ `http://localhost:8000` for live demo.
